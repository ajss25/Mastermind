# Mastermind
Play a game of Mastermind in your terminal using Python.  

## Rules & Instructions
- The objective of the game is to correctly guess the color and sequence of four pegs.  
- The pegs include: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple.  
- During each game, the program will randomly pick four pegs and arrange them, unbeknown to the player.  
- The sequence can use any combination of colors, including two or more of the same color.  
- The player has 8 attempts to find the correct color sequence of the pegs.  

- Feedback pegs are provided after each attempt by the player:  
* Black: number of pegs that are correct color and in correct position.  
* White: number of pegs that are correct color but in the wrong position.  
* Null: number of pegs that are not in the solution.  

## How to Play
- The program requires Python 3.  
- For optimal experience, set your terminal size to 105 x 30 or more.  
- To run the game, type "python3 mastermind.py" in the command line.
